**Coding exam**

## Introduction

This coding exam is to assess your understanding of software design and development principles. You will be asked to implement a new feature in an existing system. The system is a simple inventory management system for a small inn. The system keeps track of the sell-by date and quality of each item in the inventory.

## Requirements

* You must implement a new feature in the system to allow the inn to sell a new category of items: conjured items.
* Conjured items degrade in quality twice as fast as normal items.
* You must make any necessary changes to the existing UpdateQuality method or add any new code as long as everything still works correctly and you feel it works better.
* You must ensure that the quality of an item can never increase above 50, except for the legendary item "Sulfuras", which has a quality of 80 and never changes.

**Instructions**

1. Copy and paste the code from the Fiddle link into an IDE you are familiar with.
2. Refactor the code as needed.
3. Implement the new feature to allow the inn to sell conjured items.
4. Test the code to ensure that it works correctly.
5. Submit your code and a README file that explains your approach and any changes you made to the code.

## Tips

* Use a version control system such as Git to track your changes.
* Write unit tests to ensure that your code works as expected.
* Refactor your code to make it more readable and maintainable.
* Document your code so that others can understand it.

**Submission**

Submit your code and README file to the provided link.

**Good luck!**
